## Now with colour!

## Disclaimer
Colored hitcircles will seem a little dull. This is so transparency works and they're not just coloured squares.. I think..

## Requirements

* Python
* Pillow module (```pip install pillow``` or ```python3 -m pip install Pillow``` in a terminal)


## Usage

### TLDR version

1. Download this repository
2. Place the files into your skin foler
3. Run the python file 
4. Answer the two questions: @2x files are needed for the @2x option and two hex values are required for the hitcircles to be coloured (they can be the same colour btw)
5. That's it! Reload your skin/open osu! and your circles will now be instafade. The original files will be in a folder titled "old_circles"

### Detailed version

#### Python setup
1. Download [python](www.python.org) and make sure to add it to PATH in the setup wizard
